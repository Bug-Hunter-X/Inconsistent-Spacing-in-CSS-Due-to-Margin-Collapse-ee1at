The following CSS code snippet has a potential issue where the selector `.container` might not behave as expected.  It uses a common mistake of relying on default browser behavior for padding and margin collapsing, which can lead to unexpected spacing inconsistencies across different browsers and content variations.

```css
.container {
  padding: 20px;
  margin: 10px;
}
.container > div {
  background-color: lightblue;
  margin: 0; /* this margin might not always override default browser behavior */
}
```
