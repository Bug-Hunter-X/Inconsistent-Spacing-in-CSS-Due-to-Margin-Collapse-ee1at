This repository demonstrates a common CSS issue involving margin collapse and inconsistent spacing behavior. The `bug.css` file shows the problematic code, and `bugSolution.css` presents a solution that avoids these issues.  The issue stems from the default browser behavior with margin collapsing. This can create unpredictable spacing, especially when dealing with nested elements and varying content heights.  The solution provided emphasizes clearer spacing management and avoiding reliance on default behavior.
